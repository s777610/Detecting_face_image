This application is able to detect human faces and draw the rectangle on the face. 
It uses OpenCV, which is python library, to load the Cascade classifier in order to detect faces.
First of all, the image will be modified to become grayscale images.
The reason for converting to grayscale images is that it is able to increase detecting accuracy.
After that, the scaleFactor and minNeighbors should be set. 
The lower scaleFactor you set, the higher accuracy you will get. 
However, it would take a longer time to detect.
